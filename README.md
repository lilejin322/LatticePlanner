# Recruitment
Since Baidu Apollo's lattice planner is embedded in the planning module using C++, it has a very high degree of coupling. 
This has made it difficult to conduct effective white-box testing on the lattice algorithm. We have extracted the core
processing algorithm and related support classes of this planner and translated them into Python code. The project is
not yet complete and we need more collaborators. We plan to integrate and conduct corresponding experiments using environments 
such as Pygame and Gym. Interested teams are welcome to contact me: li.lejin.147@s.kyushu-u.ac.jp
